# How to Lock Aspect Ratios for Responsive Media in Figma App

When designing responsive interfaces, maintaining consistent aspect ratios across different screen sizes is crucial. Figma provides powerful tools to help you lock aspect ratios and ensure your designs scale beautifully.

## Why Aspect Ratios Matter

Aspect ratios are fundamental to responsive design. They ensure that:

- Images maintain their proportions across devices
- Layouts remain visually balanced
- Content hierarchy stays consistent
- User experience remains optimal

## Locking Aspect Ratios in Figma

Here's how to lock aspect ratios in Figma:

1. Select the frame or image you want to lock
2. In the right sidebar, look for the constraints section
3. Click the lock icon between width and height values
4. Your aspect ratio is now locked!

## Best Practices

When working with aspect ratios in responsive design:

- Use common aspect ratios like 16:9, 4:3, or 1:1
- Test your designs at multiple breakpoints
- Consider performance implications of large images
- Use Figma's auto-layout for flexible components

## Conclusion

Mastering aspect ratios in Figma is essential for creating professional, responsive designs. Practice these techniques to improve your workflow and deliver better results.
